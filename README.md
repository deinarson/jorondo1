### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm studying Cellular and molecular biology at UniversitÃ© de Sherbrooke, in Canada. I have a bachelor's degree in Economics and I speak French, English and German.
</p>
<p>I'm currently doing an internship in Laforest-Lapointe Lab, where I'm learning to use different tools to process metagenomic data from samples to analysis.
This lab deals in microbial ecology, so I apply these tools in the context of microbiome studies in humans and plants.</p>
